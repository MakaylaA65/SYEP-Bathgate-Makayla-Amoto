        <h2>About Me</h2>
</p> My favorite color is pink. I'm not a sports person, but one of my favorite sports I like to play is badminnton. Out of all my hobbies, one of my favorite is to read because it helps me relax. It's also more intresting when I watch a show and they make a book about it before like the book "The Summer I turned Pretty". Since I was a kid, I always had the passion to help people, which is why I want to become a medical doctor. I also have a kind personality, which a lot of people like about me.
